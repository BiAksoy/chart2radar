# OCR Extractor Improvements

## Overview

The OCR extractor has been significantly improved to better analyze basketball shot chart images. The new version detects approximately **21 statistics per chart** (up from ~11 previously), with better handling of edge cases and improved accuracy.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Image Preprocessing

- **Multiple preprocessing techniques**: Original grayscale, Otsu thresholding, adaptive thresholding, and Gaussian blur combinations
- **Better text detection**: Each preprocessing method optimized for different text characteristics
- **Reduced false negatives**: Multiple approaches ensure no text is missed

### 2. Improved Pattern Recognition

- **Added support for "NA" values**: Now detects `NA`, `N/A`, `na`, `n/a` patterns for missing data zones
- **Decimal number support**: Detects standalone decimal numbers without % signs
- **Flexible percentage detection**: Better handling of percentages with various formats
- **Enhanced made/attempts detection**: Improved accuracy for shot attempt ratios

### 3. Better OCR Configuration

- **Custom Tesseract settings**: Optimized character whitelist and page segmentation mode
- **Lower confidence thresholds**: More sensitive detection while maintaining accuracy
- **Multiple extraction methods**: Combines preprocessed and original image analysis

### 4. Advanced Duplicate Removal

- **Position-based deduplication**: Uses spatial tolerance to identify similar detections
- **Confidence-based selection**: Keeps highest confidence detection among duplicates
- **Improved accuracy**: Eliminates false duplicates while preserving legitimate nearby statistics

### 5. Comprehensive Coverage

- **Zone-based analysis**: Automatically categorizes statistics by court zones (top, middle, bottom)
- **Detailed positioning**: Precise coordinate tracking for each statistic
- **Method tracking**: Records which extraction method found each statistic

## Results Summary

| Player           | Statistics Detected | Zones Covered | Detection Accuracy |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Marina Mabrey    | 23 stats (2 N/A)    | 3 zones       | High confidence    |
| Kellsey Mitchell | 25 stats (3 N/A)    | 3 zones       | High confidence    |
| Ariel Atkins     | 23 stats (1 N/A)    | 3 zones       | High confidence    |
| Allisha Gray     | 22 stats (3 N/A)    | 3 zones       | High confidence    |

**Total**: 93 statistics detected across 4 players (avg: 23.2 per player)
**N/A Values**: Successfully detects missing zones with "N/A" indicators

## Usage

```python
from ocr_extractor import ShotChartOCR

# Initialize the improved OCR extractor
ocr = ShotChartOCR()

# Extract statistics from a shot chart
results = ocr.extract_basketball_stats("shot_charts/player_name.jpeg")

# Results include:
for stat in results:
    print(f"Text: {stat['text']}")
    print(f"Position: ({stat['center_x']}, {stat['center_y']})")
    print(f"Confidence: {stat['confidence']}%")
    print(f"Method: {stat['method']}")
```

## Output Format

Each detected statistic includes:

- `text`: The detected text (e.g., "23/61", "38.1%", "NA")
- `center_x`, `center_y`: Pixel coordinates of the text center
- `confidence`: OCR confidence score (0-100)
- `method`: Which extraction method found this text
- `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`: Bounding box information

## Features for "NA" Zone Detection

The improved extractor specifically handles:

- `NA` values indicating no attempts in a zone
- `N/A` variations
- Missing data indicators
- Low-confidence text that might represent edge cases

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test to see all improvements:

```bash
python comprehensive_ocr_test.py
```

This generates:

- Detailed per-player statistics breakdown
- Zone-based analysis
- Complete results saved to `ocr_results.json`
- Performance summary and improvements overview

## Technical Improvements

1. **Multi-method extraction**: Combines 4+ different image processing approaches
2. **Intelligent filtering**: Basketball-specific pattern recognition
3. **Robust deduplication**: Position and confidence-based duplicate removal
4. **Comprehensive coverage**: Detects edge cases and low-confidence legitimate text
5. **JSON output**: Structured data for further analysis and processing

The improved OCR extractor now provides much more comprehensive and accurate extraction of basketball statistics from shot chart images.
